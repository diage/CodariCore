/*
 * Need to create interim object called a 'Queue' - Simple implementation is easy, you pass in an arena to the constructor
 * and it just gets the number of teams required for that arena and potentially the team size. Once the number of teams in 
 * the queue is equal to the number required, it begins the arena and the arena can check a lot of the stuff for us. 
 * 
 * A more complicated implementation is to do a lot of the checks within the queue in which case you will either need to copy over
 * variables from the arena or save a reference to the arena. You will most likely need a queue manager within arena manager which ties
 * a queue to an ArenaName. 
 * 
 * In either case, the CommandSender ought to only check the parameters passed in to it and then do nothing else, let all the other objects
 * do those. Basically just check if a queue with the provided name exists, if so, try to add to queue and let the queue do the rest.
 * 
 * Whether you put the checks in the queue or the Arena Start is not terribly relevant at the moment.
